# cuckoo-hashing
Two separate implementions to visualize cuckoo hashing in C++

1. Cuckoo Hashing is an implementation done purely in C++ using text file input and terminal output
2. Cuckoo_Hash is created in XCode using C++ and the SDL2 development library

Motivation: I was given the idea to visualize Cuckoo Hashing while researching the scheme for a Basic Algorithms course. Initially I wrote code to simulate it in the command line, but it seemed much better to simulate it through graphics. 

Built With: 
   Xcode
   C++
   SDL2
